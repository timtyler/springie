Why not make it a *real* list of links!?! - to avoid node deletion troubles?
 Can't do that at the moment - since the renderer needs the numerical index
  of each link...

 Look at Io/Smalltalk - and other things first
 Do this at about the same time as implementing "undo"?

GarbageCollection - faces not done yet...
